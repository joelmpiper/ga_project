This directory includes all of the ipython notebooks used for this project. Notebooks found in other places in the directory structure are actually soft links to notebooks here.

- Benchmark\_Walkthrough.ipynb takes the beat-the-benchmark code from the kaggle forums and runs through it step-by-step, expanding pieces and exploring alternatives to clarify the process.

- ExploreTrainingData.ipynb examines loading the training output (y) data and extracting some simple information about it.

- Explore\_Sensor\_Model.ipynb examines the training (X) data and extracts some simple information about it.

- SinglePointWalkthrough.ipynb chooses a single output location and a few relevant input locations, a single time and model and explores some basic statistics and plots. This notebook was used to generate the plots used in the first General Assembly presentation.

- Spark\_Test.ipynb loads Apache Spark and runs some simple Spark functions.

- TestExtractionFunction.ipynb is a companion to the larger project of automating the creation of pandas dataframes, simple plots, and the analysis infrastructure. It always an interactive companion to test functions and gain simple insights as the code is developed in text files.
