This directory contains the first presentation to general assembly, which includes a project description, the data used, simple explorations, and the next steps. The *pdf* file is the actual presentation used. Unfortunately the PowerPoint for the presentation was lost (ironically during an attempt to upload it to github). I have also included a softlink to the ipython notebook used to explore the data and produce the plots.
