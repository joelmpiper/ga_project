# ga_project
Project for General Assembly

The functionality and documentation of the project is split between the slides, notebooks, and scripts directories. Each of these directories has its own README.md file to provide documentation. The data directory stores the data used for the analysis. The other directories are mostly for temporary storage or other files that are not dependent on the  project.
