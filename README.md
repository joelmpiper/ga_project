In the process of switching the analysis infrastructure from beat-the-benchmark to my code. There are still some transition issues between the stages of the analysis. The wrangle code should return appropriate subsets of the variables for train X, y and test X, but I need to transition the model to take this input instead of the beat-the-benchmark input. The chain should work with *benchmark* set to *True*.
